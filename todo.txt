TREC01A                  -- this wil be the structure of generated igm , if the uploaded igm has only cargo and contain section. ask user to if he/she wants to add default manifest and vesinfo  , 
, folow the above structure for generation i.e cargo / conatain section inside manifest and  vesinfo is above cargo section but  also lies  with in the manifest tag.  also it can be edited  before saving it. can it be done ? what u will do?


ii> add a fallback in igm parsing only if cargo or container section is present 
,?, then also parse the data with what tags are available. donot stop parsing. 
show which tags/ data were missing -- in warnings.  upon generation . all  missing value to be replaced with default , given previously.
if your  require default values of all headers .ask me.  therefore igm that will be generated will be according to ices format .
please note this should not break already working and tested features and parsing logic that is present already .



iii>generate IGM from a pdf file 

iv> make a  excel report from the IGM

v >   igm from JSON

vi >  export to excel and json from IGM

7>  total weight of the containers in the list.
